- Add Test Code for Coarsening the Full Operator. Similar to existing D_c = R D_fine P,
  but rather than piecemeal coarsenings, the returned Coarse Gauge and Clover Fields should be added into
  a linear operator which can be applied.

- Add Solvers on Coarse Datatypes: BICGSTAB would be the first one -- use as a 'bottom solver'

- Create 2 Level MultiGrid Test to demonstrate machinery.

Code Fork: 
    Start to go towards more optimized infrastructure, or go towards 3rd level?

3rd level: 
    Add MR and FGMRES on Coarse Datatypes -- BiCGStab already existing 
    Add Coarse->Coarse Transfer operators. Will need Coarse-Dslash equivalent of "DslashDir" for the nearest neighbor part.
    Create n-level VCycle.

====== Done for Prototype Milestone

Even Odd Preconditioning Tricks

Other Tricks: 
    'Global Mode deflation -- e.g. FGMRES-DR -- needs to resurrect Chroma FGMRES-DR and would need Lapack
                              or:  GCRO-DR -- as we heard at SC

    Multiple Right Hand Sides? This is primarily an optimization tho right?
   
Multi-Node: 
    Want to do the multi-node features only once,

Optimization: Need optimized infrastructure.
