-- Code Cleanup;
     *)  Get rid of old 'stubs' code for creating VCycle
     *)  Rationalize the parameters that are currently split between mg_level_qdpxx.h, mg_level_coarse.h  etc 
     *)  If possible move solver code out of headers into .cpp files so multiple definitions are avoided and we can drop the -Wl,-zmuldefs linker flag
 
-- Integraton into Chroma for Unpreconditioned Operator - to check working


====== Done for Prototype Milestone

Even Odd Preconditioning Tricks

====
    
Other Tricks: 
     More Convoluted Setups (e.g. Frommer's/Luscher's)

     GCR instead of FGMRES  (may have smaller memory footprint)

    'Global Mode deflation -- e.g. FGMRES-DR -- needs to resurrect Chroma FGMRES-DR and would need Lapack
       unless I want to recreate the QR etc. nonsense. I could look at doing this with Eigen?

                              or:  GCRO-DR -- as we heard at SC

    Multiple Right Hand Sides? This is primarily an optimization or do we need to reprototype
   
Optimization: Need optimized infrastructure.
