-- Implement 3 level vcycle (QDP->Coarse->Coarse)
-- Aniso back into fine operator

====== Done for Prototype Milestone

Even Odd Preconditioning Tricks

====
    
Other Tricks: 
     More Convoluted Setups (e.g. Frommer's/Luscher's)

     GCR instead of FGMRES  (may have smaller memory footprint)

    'Global Mode deflation -- e.g. FGMRES-DR -- needs to resurrect Chroma FGMRES-DR and would need Lapack
       unless I want to recreate the QR etc. nonsense. I could look at doing this with Eigen?

                              or:  GCRO-DR -- as we heard at SC

    Multiple Right Hand Sides? This is primarily an optimization or do we need to reprototype
   
Multi-Node: 
    Want to do the multi-node features only once,

Optimization: Need optimized infrastructure.
