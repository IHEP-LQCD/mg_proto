3/21/17 - Easy general level creation, and VCycle Creation added. Ready to interface to Chroma
 
3/15/17 - Basic Comms Structure added (SpinorHaloCB Object)
           Comms added into CoarseDirac Op (Blocking, no comms compute overlap)
           Comms added into Coarse DslashDir (Blocking comms only in the direction we work)
           Global reductions added into BLAS for Coarse Vectors (not needed for ops on blocks, just for global BLAS)
           3 Level Vcycle test is working currently with multiple MPI Tasks

2/23/17 - Single Node: Recursive v-cycle added into test_vcycle
	  - Create VCycleCoarse from L1->L2 with unpreconditioned FGMRES Bottom Solver
          - Use this as Preconditioner for L1 FGMRES solver
          - Create VCycleQDPXXCoarse2 from L0->L1 with L1 preconditioned FGMRES solver
	  - Solver converges, both for random and unit gauge.

2/23/17- Single Node: Coarse BiCGStab and MR added
	 Templates removed from fine QDPXX BiCGStab and MR solvers.

2/22/17 - Single node: Blocking issues hopefully fixed operator better understood.
	- Coarse Coarse Blocking Seems to be in initial working state (again, single node)
