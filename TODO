-- Implement coarse coarse vcycle
-- Implement 3 level vcycle (QDP->Coarse->Coarse)
-- Aniso back into fine operator

-- NOTE: DEBUG: 8x8x8x8 lattice with 2x2x2x2 blocking gives bad results for fake operator
                8x8x8x8 lattice with 4x4x4x4 blocking is fine (coarse grid is 2x2x2x2)
	        8x8x8x8 lattice with 1x1x1x1 blocking is fine (coarse grid is 8x8x8x8)

Investigate.. this

====== Done for Prototype Milestone

Even Odd Preconditioning Tricks

====
    
Other Tricks: 
     More Convoluted Setups (e.g. Frommer's/Luscher's)

     GCR instead of FGMRES  (may have smaller memory footprint)

    'Global Mode deflation -- e.g. FGMRES-DR -- needs to resurrect Chroma FGMRES-DR and would need Lapack
       unless I want to recreate the QR etc. nonsense. I could look at doing this with Eigen?

                              or:  GCRO-DR -- as we heard at SC

    Multiple Right Hand Sides? This is primarily an optimization or do we need to reprototype
   
Multi-Node: 
    Want to do the multi-node features only once,

Optimization: Need optimized infrastructure.
