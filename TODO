Code Fork: 
    Start to go towards more optimized infrastructure, or go towards 3rd level?

either: 

3rd level: 
    Add MR and BICGSTAB on Coarse Datatypes -- BiCGStab already existing 
    Add Coarse->Coarse Transfer operators. 
    If we want to have different numbers of vectors on each level we will need:
 	- a random number generator to use in the Coarse Spinors (full solution would have site based RNG)
	- We will need a CoarseDslash equivalent of DslashDir
    
    create n-level VCycle.

====== Done for Prototype Milestone

Even Odd Preconditioning Tricks

====
    
Other Tricks: 
     GCR instead of FGMRES  (may have smaller memory footprint)

    'Global Mode deflation -- e.g. FGMRES-DR -- needs to resurrect Chroma FGMRES-DR and would need Lapack
       unless I want to recreate the QR etc. nonsense. I could look at doing this with Eigen?

                              or:  GCRO-DR -- as we heard at SC

    Multiple Right Hand Sides? This is primarily an optimization or do we need to reprototype
   
Multi-Node: 
    Want to do the multi-node features only once,

Optimization: Need optimized infrastructure.
