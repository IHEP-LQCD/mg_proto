This is a discussion of spinors:

i) A spinor is:
	- a chunk of memory to hold Nc * Ns * V complex numbers or
	  Nc * Ns * V * N complex real numbers (Template FType)
	 (Nc, Ns, V are available in LatticeInfo)
	 
	- memory to hold ghost layers in a multi-node implementation
	  Boundary sizes are available from LatticeInfo in terms of
	  sites
	  
    - a data layout augments lattice info by specifying padding
      and fundamentally defines how the index space
         (x,y,z,t,Nc,Ns,Ncomplex) is laid out
      
      See section ii) about Layouts
 
	NB: This Generalizes also to coarse vectors. 
      
      Choices here can for example be:
      
      	 AOS layout  Volume Ns Nc Ncomplex (fastest) 
         SOA layout  Ns Nc Ncomplex Volume (fastest)
         AOSOA layout  Outer Ns Nc Ncomplex Inner (fastest)
         
         AOSOA can have varieties on how to split a site into
               outer and inner: e.g. QPhiX order, Peter's Grid order
               
         Layout needs extra information beyond lattice info:
           - padding of dimensions (if any)
           - 
               
         
         
Block Operations for MG:
========================

	There are occasional situations where a block form of the spinor is useful. These come in when:
